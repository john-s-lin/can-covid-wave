# Waving Goodbye to Subsequent COVID-19 Waves

## Using data from the Government of Canada on daily cases and vaccination rate to model the end of the pandemic in Canada

**Disclaimer**: Please note that this project is for my personal learning and is just for fun. Although the data is publicly accessible, these analyses should **not** be used to guide real-world decisions. Models used an idealized input and are not adequate representations of human behaviour.
