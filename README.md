# Waving Goodbye to Subsequent COVID-19 Waves

## Using data from the Government of Canada on daily cases and vaccination rate to model the end of the pandemic in Canada

**Disclaimer**: Please note that this project is for my personal learning and is just for fun. Although the data is publicly accessible, these analyses should **not** be used to guide real-world decisions. Models used an idealized input and are not adequate representations of human behaviour.

#### Update: 2021-10-29

Writing a bunch of assignments at the moment for school and have upcoming evaluations for other courses so this personal project will be put on the backburner for now. Will return when my schedule clears up slightly.
