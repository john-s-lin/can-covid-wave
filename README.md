# Waving Goodbye to Subsequent COVID-19 Waves

## Using data from the Government of Canada on daily cases and vaccination rate to model the end of the pandemic in Canada

**Disclaimer**: Please note that this project is for my personal learning and is just for fun. Although the data is publicly accessible, these analyses should **not** be used to guide real-world decisions. Models used an idealized input and are not adequate representations of human behaviour.

#### Update: 2021-12-07

**TODO**: A weaker model looks only at the shape of the curve to generate a forecast. I don't want to do that since pandemic wave modeling depends on a plethora of external factors such as vaccination rates, mask mandates, travel restrictions, distance learning, remote work, etc. The [COVID-19 Outbreak Analysis](https://covidpredictions.mit.edu/) from MIT acts as inspiration for this project.

After speaking to my Machine Learning professor, he recommended I do the following to get started before I make the leap to a real-world dataset.
[] Make a synthetic dataset with a known function and sample from it to train prediction model as a sanity check
[] Look into Facebook Prophet API for forecasting algorithms
[] Look into other forecasting models done by other universities
